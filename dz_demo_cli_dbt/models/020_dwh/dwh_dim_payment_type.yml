models:
  - name: dwh_dim_payment_type
    description: The dwh_dim_payment_type model is a dimension table in the data
      warehouse that contains information about different payment types. It is
      derived from the stg_nyt_nytgreenpaymenttypedim staging table. The model
      includes a primary key column 'payment_type_pk' which is a hashed value
      generated from the 'payment_type_id' column. If the 'payment_type_id' is
      null, a default value '_dbt_utils_surrogate_key_null_' is used for
      hashing.
    columns:
      - name: payment_type_id
        description: This is an integer column that uniquely identifies the type of
          payment. It is derived from the source table
          stg_nyt_nytgreenpaymenttypedim in the dw_dezerius_demo_client
          database.

      - name: payment_type_desc
        description: This column contains the description of the payment type. It is a
          variable character field that provides more details about the payment
          method used.

      - name: m_updated_at_dttm
        description: This column represents the date and time when the payment type
          record was last updated in the data warehouse. It is of datetime2 data
          type.
        data_type: datetime2
        quote: true
      - name: payment_type_pk
        description: This column is a primary key for the payment type. It is generated
          by hashing the payment_type_id column using the MD5 algorithm. If the
          payment_type_id is null, a default value
          '_dbt_utils_surrogate_key_null_' is used. The result is then converted
          to a lower case string.
